\section{Election properties}
%In this section, we describe what security properties our election system has. We also describe what each of these properties means and under what context the are reached.

%\subsection{Mobility}
%The voter can use any device (PC, laptop, tablet, smart phone), that he has and he trusts, to connect to the election system. The voter does not need to be in a special location (e.g. polling station) in order to vote. Instead, the voter can participate in the voting process being located in any place, that he considers secure and private, and that has an internet connection. 

%We claim \textit{mobility} as a property of Assembly Voting X.

% \subsection{Eligibility}
% \textit{Eligibility} is defined as the fact that only a limited number of predefined voters are allowed to cast a valid vote. 

% During the \textit{pre-election phase} (section \ref{pre-election phase}), the \textit{election administrators} define the list of eligible voters \( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{V}} = (\mathcal{V}_1, ..., \mathcal{V}_{n_\mathrm{v}}) \), where $n_\mathrm{v}$ is the total number of voters, and the list of printing authorities \( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}} = (\mathcal{P}_1, ..., \mathcal{P}_{n_\mathrm{p}}) \), where $n_\mathrm{p}$ is the total number of printing authorities.

% During the \textit{voter credential distribution process} (section \ref{credential distribution}), all \textit{printing authorities} assign a distinct public signature verification key $Y_i$ to each voter $\mathcal{V}_i$. At the same time, each \textit{printing authority} \( \mathcal{P}_j \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{P}} \) distributes to each voter their voting credentials $x_{i,j}$, with \( i \in \{ 1, ..., n_\mathrm{v} \} \) and \( j \in \{ 1, ..., n_\mathrm{p} \} \) such that \( [\sum_{j=1}^{n_\mathrm{p}} x_{i,j}]G = Y_i \). After receiving all his election credentials $x_{i,j}$, voter $\mathcal{V}_i$ can compute his private signing key \( x_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_\mathrm{p}} x_{i,j} \).

% When submitting a vote, the voter $\mathcal{V}_i$ digitally signs the vote submission with his private signing key $x_i$ and the election system accepts the vote submission only if the digital signature matches the voter's public signature verification key $Y_i$. By following this process, we make sure that the vote submission was generated by somebody in possession of $x_i$, which could only be the voter.

% One can notice that the printing authority $\mathcal{P}_j$ knows a part of the signing key of voter $\mathcal{V}_i$ but not enough. Therefore, we argue that Assembly Voting X has the \textit{eligibility property} on the assumption that there exist multiple printing authorities that do not communicate with each other during the election process.

% \subsection{Fairness}

% \clearpage
% \subsection{Privacy}
% By the term \textit{privacy of the election} we understand that nobody is able to read any votes or any part of the result unless it is supposed to, i.e. it is specified in the election protocol.

% By following the election protocol, it is guaranteed that:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item the secrecy of the vote is preserved. No votes from the bulletin board are decrypted, therefore no connection between a vote and a voter can be made.
%     \item no partial results are computed during the election process. A result is calculated only once, after the election phase has finished.
% \end{itemize}

% All votes, that are posted on the bulletin board, are encrypted using the ElGamal cryptosystem based on elliptic curve cryptography (more details in sections \ref{mathematics} and \ref{elgamal}). Moreover, using a \textit{t out of n} threshold encryption scheme (section \ref{threshold ceremony}), we enforce that there is no single entity that can perform the decryption of any data from the public bulletin board, but instead, it is needed a group of minimum $t$ trustees to collaborate.

% Therefore, we claim that Assembly Voting X has the \textit{privacy property} on the assumption that at least $t$ trustees are honest, with \( t > n / 2 \) and \( n > 2 \).

% One can argue that, because the bulletin board data is public, somebody could save all the data for long enough until the elliptic curve cryptosystem will be broken, and so will be able to decrypt all the data contrarily to our protocol. This fact demonstrates that our system does not comply to the \textit{everlasting privacy property}. We take note of this fact and we accept it.

% \subsection{Anonymity}
% The anonymity property implies the fact that nobody knows the connection between a voter identity and its decrypted vote from the final \textit{raw result} list of votes. This property is reached by implementing a mixnet of mixers that sequentially shuffle the list of vote cryptograms in an indistinguishable way, before they get decrypted (section \ref{sec:mixing_phase}).

% Obviously, each mixer knows the way it shuffled the list of cryptograms but it does not know how it was shuffled by the other mixers. Thus, it is important that mixers do not communicate with each other.

% We claim that Assembly Voting X is an \textit{anonymous voting system} on the assumption that there is a mixnet of multiple mixers out of which at least one is honest.

% \clearpage
% \subsection{Integrity}
% We define the \textit{integrity} of an election as the property that all data recorded during the election is never modified or deleted.

% The integrity of the election is preserved in our system by publishing all events (vote submissions or system events) on the bulletin board. Moreover, the bulletin board has a \textit{blockchain-like} structure that guarantees that the history of the bulletin board never changes. Also, the voters act like miners of the blockchain whenever they submit a new vote cryptogram, by signing on the history of the blockchain.

% Every time a new vote submission is appended on the bulletin board, the voter receives a vote receipt $\rho_i$ that contains a pointer to the item on the bulletin board, called \textit{the board hash value} $h_{\mathrm{b}, i}$. This value is computed based on the previous \textit{board hash value} $h_{\mathrm{b}, i-1}$, which is computed based on the one before, and so on, until it reaches the \textit{genesis hash}, which is 0. This means that every time a voter checks his voter receipt, the entire bulletin board history is validated.

% We claim that Assembly Voting X achieves the \textit{integrity property} through the bulletin board construction.

% \subsection{Verifiability}
% All steps of the election protocol are verifiable (more details in section \ref{auditing}). There are two levels of verifiability that can be performed by different actors. Some steps are individually verifiable (i.e. only the voter that is currently performing this step can verify that the process is happening correctly), such as:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item verify that the vote is cast as intended
%     \item verify that the vote is registered as cast
% \end{itemize}
% The rest of the steps from the election protocol are publicly verifiable:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item the threshold ceremony
%     \item the bulletin board history
%     \item the integrity and eligibility of each vote submission
%     \item the integrity of each system event
%     \item the correctness of the cleansing procedure, mixing phase and decryption phase (verification that votes are counted as registered)
% \end{itemize}

% We claim that Assembly Voting X is a \textit{verifiable election system}.

% % \subsection{Accountability}
% \clearpage
% \subsection{Receipt-freeness}
% We define the \textit{receipt-free} property as the fact that a voter is not able to prove to a third party the way he voted, after he submitted his vote cryptogram.

% During the \textit{vote cryptogram generation process} (section \ref{vote cryptogram generation}), the voter receives from the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ an empty cryptogram $e_0$ that he uses to generate his final vote cryptogram $e$ in order to encrypt his vote $M$. At the end of the process, the vote cryptogram $e$ would be equal to \( \mathbf{Enc}_{Y_\mathrm{enc}} (M, r_0 + r_1) \), where $r_0$ is known by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ and $r_1$ is known by the voter. The voter is convinced that $e_0$ is an empty cryptogram because of a interactive proof $PK_0$ generated between the voter and the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$. 

% The empty cryptogram $e_0$ and the proof $PK_0$ are relevant only for the communication amongst the voter and the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$, to make sure that none of them has the entire randomness value $r_0 + r_1$ that is used to generate the cryptogram $e$. Therefore, $e_0$ and $PK_0$ are not included on the bulletin board, thus not publicly available.

% After the vote cryptogram $e$ has been accepted on the board, the voter is not able to produce valid cryptographic evidence that $e$ is an encryption of $M$ referencing only the data that is publicly available. More details are described in section \ref{vote-lie}.

% Therefore, we claim that Assembly Voting X is a \textit{receipt-free} voting protocol.
