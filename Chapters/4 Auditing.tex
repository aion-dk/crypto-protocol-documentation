\section{Auditing} \label{sec: auditing}
This section describes the entire auditing process of an election. It describes all the verification mechanisms, who conducts them, and what cryptographic algorithms they involve. These verification mechanisms can be split into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item voter-specific verification mechanisms that can be performed individually by voters and target their specific vote (\cref{sec: voter-specific verifications}),
    \item internal auditing processes performed by election officials that target the behavior of the election system (\cref{sec: administration auditing process}),
    \item publicly available audit processes that verify all data on the public bulletin board (\cref{sec: public auditing process}).
\end{itemize}
