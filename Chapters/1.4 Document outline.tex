\subsection{Document outline}
\Cref{sec:solution entities} lists the various elections roles actively involved in elections and the communication channels that they use.

\Cref{sec: election protocol} discusses the cryptographic algorithms and the entities involved in the life cycle of an election, from pre-election, over election, to the post-election processes.

\Cref{sec: auditing} discusses the individual, public and private auditing processes, including the actors participating, that all together facilitates the  end-to-end verifiability of the entire election.

\Cref{sec: threat model} discusses the trust assumptions outside of the cryptographic algorithms, the threats arising from them, and how they are mitigated.

\Cref{app: theoretical background} lists the applied cryptographic algorithms and their mathematical principles.
