\subsection{Intended audience}
The document is primarily targeting cryptographers or technical, mathematical readers. This document is intended as an argumentation for the security claims we make about the election protocol. It contains mathematical descriptions of all algorithms used throughout the protocol.

The adversary model in \cref{sec: adversary model} provides a non-cryptographic description of the attack scenarios that the election protocol protects against. This section could interest readers with a more general interest in security in online election systems.
