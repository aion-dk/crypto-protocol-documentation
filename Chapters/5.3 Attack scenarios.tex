\subsection{Attack scenarios} \label{sec: attack scenarios}
Here, we present an extensive list of attacks that we considered and might happen to an election. We also describe how the attack is detected and how the system responds. Finally, in \cref{sec: disruptive attacks}, we describe some attacks that the protocol only provides a way to detect. If they successfully happen, it is up to election officials to assess the damage and decide on a resolution, e.g., repeat the election event.
