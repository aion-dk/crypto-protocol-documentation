\subsection{Stakeholders} \label{sec: stakeholders}

This section describes the human actors that have a stake in an election. All stakeholders can be grouped into four categories.

\subsubsection{Election officer}
Election officers use the election system to configure and run an election. Election officers own credentials that are used to access different election components, such as the election administration service. Election officers have an interest in the election running correctly, according to the configuration they set up.

\subsubsection{Trustee}
Trustees are a particular type of election officers. In addition to the election officer role, trustees are responsible for preserving the secrecy of the voting data throughout the election. As described in the protocol, trustees are exposed to keys that they have to protect and keep secret. Trustees are crucial to the election protocol, as they actively participate in the result computation.

\subsubsection{Voter}
All the voting data is generated by a set of predefined voters. They own credentials that get them authorized to cast a digital ballot. Voters have an interest in verifying that their vote has been processed correctly and is included in the final tally.

\subsubsection{Public auditor}
Any person can be a public auditor of the election process, assuming they have access to the proper auditing tools that will perform all the cryptographic operations on behalf of the auditor. Auditors don't have an active role in the election process, and most of the time, the auditing will happen without the election system noticing.
