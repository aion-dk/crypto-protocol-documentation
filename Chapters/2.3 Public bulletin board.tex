\subsection{Public bulletin board} \label{sec: public bulletin board}
All events that happen during an election are published by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ as items on a publicly available bulletin board. Each item from the board is owned (or written) by a relevant actor. Each item posted on the bulletin board describes a specific event and it is uniquely identifiable by its \textit{hash value} or \textit{address}. The \textit{address} of the last item on the board represents the \textit{board hash value} at that specific point in time. All events are stored as an \textit{append only list}, that means, no event can be removed or replaced and each new event is appended at the end of the list. The structure of the bulletin board has been inspired from \cite{Heather09}.

The way we deviate from \cite{Heather09} is that, to append a new item on the board, the writer needs to include as part of the new item the address of any existing item from the board, instead of referencing exactly the previous item. We call this reference, the parent item. Finally, the \textit{address} of the new item is computed by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ by hashing the content of the item (including the reference to the parent item) concatenated with the current \textit{board hash value} and a registration timestamp. $\mathcal{D}$ signs the \textit{address} of the new item and delivers it to the writer as proof of acceptance of the new item on the board. Note that it is the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} that ensures the link of the new item to the previous item on the board.

As a result of this modification, each item from the bulletin board references 2 other items:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An existing item that the writer chooses as the parent item
    \item The previous item of the board
\end{enumerate}

This modification to the bulletin board structure implies that the \textit{history} property described in \cite{Heather09} is protected in this case by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box}. Furthermore, we introduce a new property to the bulletin board called \textit{ancestry} which is defined by items being related to each other in a meaningful way. As a result, when traversed on the \textit{ancestry} line, the structure of the bulletin board looks like a tree, while, when traversed on the \textit{history} line, the structure looks linear. 

In addition, we introduce a new concept to the bulletin board structure, that we call a \emph{hidden verification track}, that is used to perform the ballot checking process described in \cref{sec: challenging a vote cryptogram}. It is called:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{hidden} because this track is not publicly available as part of the bulletin board, instead, it is available on request based on the \textit{address} of a specific item.
    \item \textit{verification} because this track is used only for the purpose of the ballot checking process.
    \item \emph{track} because it spawns an extra \textit{history} of events that is injected under a specific item from the main \textit{history}.
\end{itemize}

As a consequence of these modifications, any $i^\mathrm{th}$ item from the bulletin board consists of the following tuple $(m_i, c_i, \mathcal{W}, \sigma_i, p_i, h_{i-1}, t_i, h_i)$, where $m_i$ is the type of the item, $c_i$ is the content of the item that describes the event, $\mathcal{W}$ is a reference to the writer of the item, $\sigma_i$ is the writer's signature, $p_i$ is the \textit{address} of the parent item with $p_i \in \{h_1, ..., h_{i-1}\}$, $h_{i-1}$ is the \textit{address} of the previous item in the \textit{history}, $t_i$ is the registration timestamp and $h_i$ is the item \textit{address}.

The different kinds of items (i.e. the values that $m_i$ can have) and the events they support are described in \cref{sec: bulletin board event types}. The rules about how items can reference a parent item are also described in this section.

In order to write a new item on the bulletin board, a writer needs to follow the protocol described in \cref{sec: writing on the bulletin board}. The following actors are allowed to write on the bulletin board:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Election Administrator} $\mathcal{E}$ is the actor that writes all the configuration events of an election.
    \item \textit{Voters} $\mathcal{V}_i$, with $i \in \{1, ..., n_\mathrm{v}\}$, are the actors that write all the vote related events of an election.
    \item \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ is the actor that ultimately accepts all the events that are published on the bulletin board. In addition, $\mathcal{D}$ also writes on the board all the auxiliary events that support the voting process.
    \item \textit{External Verifier} $\mathcal{X}$ is the actor that writes events related to ballot checking process. These events are written on the hidden verification track of the bulletin board.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Writing on the bulletin board} \label{sec: writing on the bulletin board}
This section describes the protocol that any writer needs to follow in order to write an event on the bulletin board. The election protocol allows a predefined set of actors ($\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{V}_i$, $\mathcal{D}$ or $\mathcal{X}$) to write events on the bulletin board, but for the sake of generalization, \cref{fig: protocol for writing an item on the bulletin board} presents the interaction between a generic writer $\mathcal{W}$ and the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$ necessary for publishing the $i^{th}$ event on the bulletin board.

    \caption{Protocol for writing an item on the bulletin board}
    \label{fig: protocol for writing an item on the bulletin board}
\end{figure}

The publicly available information consists of: the public key of the writer $Y_\mathcal{W}$, the public key of the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $Y_\mathcal{D}$ and all the already existing items on the bulletin board with their respective addresses $\boldsymbol{h} = \{h_1, ... h_{i-1}\}$. The writer alone is in possession of his private key $x_\mathcal{W}$, while the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} is in possession of its private key $x_\mathcal{D}$.

The protocol starts by the writer actively choosing the event type $m_i$ and the content $c_i$ to be appended on the bulletin board as the $i^\mathrm{th}$ item. All the event types are described in the \cref{sec: bulletin board event types}. The content of the item is a text blob describing a specific event. The structure of the message has to follow the rules described in \cref{sec: bulletin board event types} depending on the type of item chosen. Then, the writer chooses a pre-existing item on the bulletin board as the parent of the new item. The parent item is referenced by its address $p_i \in \boldsymbol{h}$. The choice of parent item is done according to the rules described in \cref{sec: bulletin board event types} depending on the type of item chosen.

The writer signs with his private key $x_\mathcal{W}$ the concatenation of the new item type, the content and the parent address. The signature $\sigma_i \gets \mathsf{Sign}(x_\mathcal{W}; m_i || c_i || p_i)$ is sent together with the item type $m_i$, the content $c_i$ and the parent address $p_i$ to the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} as a request to append the new item on the board.

\textit{Digital Ballot Box} verifies whether $m_i$, $c_i$ and $p_i$ are chosen according to the rules specified in \cref{sec: bulletin board event types} and whether the request has a valid signature. If all validations succeed, \textit{Digital Ballot Box} computes the address of the new item $h_i$ by hashing a concatenation of the type of the new item $m_i$, its content $c_i$, its parent hash value $p_i$, the current board hash value $h_{i-1}$ and the registration timestamp $t_i$. It then stores the new item on the bulletin board as the tuple $(m_i, c_i, \mathcal{W}, \sigma_i, t_i, p_i, h_i)$, where $\mathcal{W}$ is a reference to the writer.

The \textit{Digital Ballot Box} signs with its private key $x_\mathcal{D}$ the concatenation of the writer's signature $\sigma_i$ and the address of the new item $h_i$. The resulting signature $\rho_i$ is sent together with the registration timestamp $t_i$, the new board hash value $h_i$ and the previous board hash value $h_{i-1}$ to the writer as proof that the item has been appended on the board.

Finally, the writer verifies whether the address of the new item is computed correctly and whether the response has a valid signature.

Note that, when the protocol is performed by a specific writer, for example, the \textit{Voter} $\mathcal{V}_i$, the writer's key pair $(x_\mathcal{W}, Y_\mathcal{W})$ will be replaced by the voter's key pair $(x_i, Y_i)$.


\subsubsection{Bulletin board event types} \label{sec: bulletin board event types}
The bulletin board has been designed as a self-documented event log. In order to support that, it needs to contain many kinds of items that are documenting different events throughout the election, such as events related to election configuration, events related to the voting process or events related to challenging a vote cryptogram process (described in \cref{sec: challenging a vote cryptogram}). Each event is documented as an item on the bulletin board.

All bulletin board items have many of the same attributes in their structure, that is listed below which is to be called \textbf{metadata}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{type} is a string that defines the type of the bulletin board item.
    \item \textit{content} is data that describes the details of the event.
    \item \textit{writer} is a reference to the writer of the item (e.g. a \textit{Voter} or the \textit{Digital Ballot Box}).
    \item \textit{signature} is a digital signature of the writer on the item.
    \item \textit{registration time} is a timestamp documenting when the event happened.
    \item \textit{parent} is a reference to a previously existing item on the bulletin board.
    \item \textit{address} is a unique identifier for each item on the board.
\end{itemize}

The bulletin board items will have additional attributes which will differ in addition to some rules that are also varying depending on the item type.

All item types are described in the following list and are grouped in the following 3 categories:

\paragraph{Configuration items}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        The \textit{genesis} is the initial item of the bulletin board and it describes some metadata of the election. Basically, this is the item that spawns a new bulletin board. The structure of it consists of the \textbf{metadata} and the following attributes:

        The \textit{verification track start} is the initial item of the hidden verification track. It, basically, spawns the verification track of each ballot cryptogram. It is generated as a response to the \textit{ballot cryptograms} item being posted.  The structure of it consists only of \textbf{metadata}. The following rules apply to the \textit{verification track start} item:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is written by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$.
            \item It has as \textit{parent} the \textit{ballot cryptograms} item.
            \item It is appended on the hidden verification track.
            \item A new item is generated whenever a new \textit{ballot cryptograms} item is appended on the bulletin board.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item
        The \textit{verifier} is the item that defines the details of the \textit{External Verifier} $\mathcal{X}$. The structure of it consists of the \textbf{metadata} and the public key of the \textit{External Verifier} $Y_\mathcal{X}$. The following rules apply to the \textit{verifier} item:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is written by the \textit{External Verifier} $\mathcal{X}$.
            \item It has as \textit{parent} the \textit{verification track start} item.
            \item It is appended on the hidden verification track.
            \item A new item is generated whenever an \textit{External Verifier} is used to challenge a vote cryptogram.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item
        The \textit{voter commitment opening} is the item that contain a part of the data (voter side) necessary for unpacking the spoiled encrypted ballot. This data is encrypted itself, such that only the \textit{External Verifier} can read it. The structure of it consists of the \textbf{metadata} and the encrypted data blob of the openings of the \textit{Voter's} commitment from the \textit{voter encryption commitment} item. The following rules apply to the \textit{voter commitment opening} item:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is written by the \textit{Voter} $\mathcal{V}_i$.
            \item It has as \textit{parent} the \textit{verifier} item.
            \item It is appended on the hidden verification track.
            \item A new item is generated whenever the \textit{Voter} chooses to challenge the vote cryptograms and confirms the collaboration with the \textit{External Verifier}.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item
        The \textit{server commitment opening} is the item that contain the second part of the data (server side) necessary for unpacking the spoiled encrypted ballot. This data is encrypted itself, such that only the \textit{External Verifier} can read it. This item is generated as a response to the \textit{voter commitment opening} item being posted.The structure of it consists of the \textbf{metadata} and the encrypted data blob of the openings of the commitment of the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} from the \textit{server encryption commitment} item. The following rules apply to the \textit{server commitment opening} item:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is written by the \textit{Digital Ballot Box} $\mathcal{D}$.
