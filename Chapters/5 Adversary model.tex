\section{Adversary model} \label{sec: adversary model}
This section describes the capabilities and limitations of an attacker that the system is designed to protect against. Then, it exemplifies some attack vectors and describes how the system defends against them.

Some scenarios present the way the system detects malicious activity rather than preventing it from happening. In that situation, it is up to election officers to assess the situation and make a recovery decision.
