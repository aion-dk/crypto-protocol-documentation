@article{Schoof85,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a deterministic algorithm to compute the number of $\mathbf{F}_q$-points of an elliptic curve that is defined over a finite field $\mathbf{F}_q$ and which is given by a Weierstrass equation. The algorithm takes $O(\log^9 q)$ elementary operations. As an application we give an algorithm to compute square roots $\operatorname{mod} p$. For fixed $x \in \mathbf{Z}$, it takes $O(\log^9 p)$ elementary operations to compute $\sqrt x \operatorname{mod} p$.},

	abstract = {In a threshold cryptosystem n members share the secret key of an organization such that k members (1≤k≤n) must cooperate in order to decipher a given ciphertext. In this note it is shown how to implement such a scheme without having a trusted party, which selects the secret key and distributes it to the members. In stead, the members choose the secret key and distribute it verifiably among themselves. Subsequently, this key can be used for authentication as well as secret communication.},

@inproceedings{Fiat87,
	abstract = {In this paper we describe simple identification and signature schemes which enable any user to prove his identity and the authenticity of his messages to any other user without shared or public keys. The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1{\%} to 4{\%} of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.},

@inproceedings{Chow10,
	abstract = {In Crypto'92, Chaum and Pedersen introduced a widely-used protocol (CP protocol for short) for proving the equality of two discrete logarithms (EQDL) with unconditional soundness, which plays a central role in DL-based cryptography. Somewhat surprisingly, the CP protocol has never been improved for nearly two decades since its advent. We note that the CP protocol is usually used as a non-interactive proof by using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, which inevitably relies on the random oracle model (ROM) and assumes that the adversary is computationally bounded. In this paper, we present an EQDL protocol in the ROM which saves ≈40{\%} of the computational cost and ≈33{\%} of the prover's uploading bandwidth. Our idea can be naturally extended for simultaneously showing the equality of n discrete logarithms with O(1)-size commitment, in contrast to the n-element adaption of the CP protocol which requires O(n)-size. This improvement benefits a variety of interesting cryptosystems, ranging from signatures and anonymous credential systems, to verifiable secret sharing and threshold cryptosystems. As an example, we present a signature scheme that only takes one (offline) exponentiation to sign, without utilizing pairing, relying on the standard decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.},

@inproceedings{Furukawa01,

Using this protocol, we can prove the correctness of a shuffle of n data with roughly 18n exponentiations, where as the protocol of Sako-Kilian[SK95] required 642n and that of Abe[Ab99] required 22n log n. The length of proof will be only 211                n bits in our protocol, opposed to 218                n bits and 214                n log n bits required by Sako-Kilian and Abe, respectively. The proposed protocol will be a building block of an efficient, universally verifiable mix-net, whose application to voting system is prominent.},

The advantages of employing this technology are that voters can vote-and-go, and that it is flexible enough to be used for variety of vote-expression methods, while ensuring the privacy of votes and the elimination of faulty players. The most attractive security feature of this scheme is its universal verifiability; anyone can confirm the correctness of the result.},

The proposed definition may be also useful for proving the security of verifiable shuffle-decryption, hybrid mix network, and other mix-nets.},
