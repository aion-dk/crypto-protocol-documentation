\subsection{Hash functions} \label{app: hash functions}
A \textit{cryptographic hash function} is an algorithm used for mapping data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size, also called the \textit{hash value}. We define the hash function $\mathcal{H} : \mathbb{B}^* \gets \mathbb{B}^\ell$, where $\mathbb{B}^\ell$ represents a bit array of length $\ell$. In practice, hash algorithms work on byte arrays instead of bit arrays. Thus, the length of the input or output array is $\ell/8$.

The hash value of any kind of data can be computed, for example, a string, a number, or even an object with a complex structure. The hash value would be the result of the hash function applied to the byte representation of that particular input data. A hash value can be computed for an arbitrary number of inputs at the same time. In that case, the hash function is applied to the concatenation of all byte representations of each input.

A hash function is known as a \textit{one-way function}, i.e. one can easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value but, if the input data is unknown, it is infeasible to calculate it given only a hash value. Another property of a cryptographic hash function is \textit{collision resistance}. That means it is difficult to find two different input data with the same hash values.

In our system, we will use the hash function called \textit{SHA-256} that outputs bit arrays of 256 bits in length (32-byte array).
